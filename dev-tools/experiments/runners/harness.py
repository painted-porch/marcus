"""
Per-CLI harness definitions for the Marcus experiment runner.

A *harness* is the agent CLI a spawned tmux pane runs — currently
``claude`` (Anthropic's Claude Code), ``codex`` (OpenAI's Codex CLI),
or ``gemini`` (Google's Gemini CLI).  All three speak the same Marcus
MCP protocol, but the surface around them — the exact shell command,
the worker-keepalive wrapper, the trust-dialog handling, the
workflow-file convention, and the install hint shown on a missing
binary — differs.

Before this module landed, the old spawner had six ``if/elif`` sites
spread across one ~2000-line file, one per harness-specific quirk.
Adding a third harness (e.g. ``gemini``) meant editing every site.
This module collects every harness-specific behavior into a single
:class:`Harness` Protocol with one implementation per CLI, plus a
:data:`HARNESSES` registry the spawner looks up by name.

The contract is "byte-identical rendered shell scripts": the strings
returned here must be exactly what the previous ``if/elif`` blocks
returned, so the existing ``TestCodexScriptsRender`` and sibling
tests stay green without modification.

Classes
-------
Harness
    Structural protocol every harness implementation must satisfy.
ClaudeHarness
    Default harness — Anthropic Claude Code CLI.
CodexHarness
    OpenAI Codex CLI harness with ``--enable goals`` + a bounded
    bash relaunch loop.
GeminiHarness
    Google Gemini CLI harness with ``--skip-trust --yolo`` + the
    same bounded bash relaunch loop pattern (``gemini -p`` is
    fire-and-exit like ``codex exec``).

Functions
---------
get_harness(name)
    Resolve a harness by name, raising :class:`ValueError` for
    unknown names with a list of supported choices.

Data
----
HARNESSES
    Mapping of harness name -> :class:`Harness` instance.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        Stable identifier the runner stores on ``config.harness`` and
        the user picks on the command line (``--harness <name>``).
    binary : str
        Executable name looked up on PATH during the launcher
        pre-flight.
    provider : str
        Cost-tracking provider label (``"anthropic"`` / ``"openai"``).
        Reserved for the cost ingester work tracked in issue #582 —
        ``src/cost_tracking/worker_ingester.py`` writes
        ``provider="anthropic"`` today; once #582 lands the codex
        ingester will read this field rather than hardcoding a
        provider string per code path.
    needs_trust_dialog_poll : bool
        ``True`` when the harness raises an interactive trust dialog
        on first launch in a directory; the host then polls each
        pane for the prompt and confirms it.  Claude only.
    needs_pretrust_directory : bool
        ``True`` when the harness reads a per-directory trust file
        (e.g. ``~/.claude.json``) that the host must seed before
        launch.  Claude only.
    workflow_files : Tuple[str, ...]
        Workflow filenames the launcher writes into the implementation
        directory so the agent picks up the session contract.
        For codex, both ``CLAUDE.md`` and ``AGENTS.md`` are written —
        the latter is the codex-specific convention
        (https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md).

            tmux panes where no human can confirm approvals.
        ``--skip-git-repo-check``
            Monitor pane and similar start before any commits exist;
            this stops codex from refusing to launch on an "empty"
            repository.
        ``--disable guardian_approval``
            Turns off codex's "files changed under me without my
            doing it" safety check.  Required because Marcus workers
            run ``git merge main --no-edit`` between tasks (see
            agent_prompt.md) which guardian otherwise treats as
            anomalous and halts the agent on.
        ``--enable goals``
            Turns on codex's autonomous agentic loop.  The agent
            treats the prompt as a never-ending goal and keeps
            polling instead of wrapping up after two empty cycles.

      documented equivalent of codex's
      ``--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox``.
